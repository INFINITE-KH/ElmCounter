My first counter folder contains an error that doesnt give me the connection between workbench and netbeans

The second contains rest endpoints where one of them incriment a number and the other update it. The problem with this one is that i have problems to connect it with elm
Locally I had problems running elm, therefore I am using a remote api which my partner found to advance with the assignment.
